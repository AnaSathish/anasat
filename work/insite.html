                    <a href="https://stacybranham.com/insite-lab/" target="blank">INsite Lab</a> creates universally usable technologies and educate others with the knowlegde gained.
                    I take pride in being a former member of this lab as creating accessible technologies is one of my passions.
                </p>
                <p>I worked on the development team, which built functional prototypes for research projects. 
                    We are developped a voice acitivated personal assitant (VAPA) that is more suitable for blind users as 
                    they prefer VAPAs that can change their speech rate, pitch, volume, etc. through spontaneuous voice commands.
