                    <a href="https://stacybranham.com/insite-lab/" target="blank">INsite Lab</a> creates universally usable technologies and educate others with the knowlegde we have gained.
                    I take pride in being a member of this lab as creating accessible technologies is one of my passions.
                </p>
                <p>I work on the development team, which builds functional prototypes for research projects. Currently, 
                    we are developing a voice acitivated personal assitant (VAPA) that is more suitable for blind users as 
                    they prefer VAPAs that can change their speech rate, pitch, volume, etc. through voice commands.
