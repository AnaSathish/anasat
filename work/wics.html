                    WICS is a non-profit organization at UC Irvine that helps encourage women to pursue a career in the Computer Science field and supports them to achieve their goals.
                    I joined WICS as a general member my first year of college, joined the commitee my second year, and I am currently on the board holding the Historian position where 
                    my role is to manage the <a href="https://wics.ics.uci.edu/" target="blank">WICS Website</a>. I am very proud to be a member of WICS as I am a huge advocate for more 
                    diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.

            Through the support of the WICS community, I was able to learn more about opportunities in the tech field. One of the most exciting opportunities I had was to attend the 
            annual Grace Hopper Conference in Orlando, Florida. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is the world's largest gathering of 
            women in computing. It was an amazing experience to be able to network with so many individuals who 
            share the same passions as me. It helped me realize that there are so many facets to the tech field, and 
            I could achieve anything imaginable.

            I have also helped organize many outreach programs such as <a href="https://wics.ics.uci.edu/just-code-it/" target="blank"><i>Just Code It</i></a> where we taught middle school girls
            the basics of Web Development.

            Through WICS and its strong community, I have learned all that is possible in the tech field
            and I am also able to pay forward the new knowledge and perspectives I have gained.
