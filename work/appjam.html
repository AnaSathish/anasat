                <p>I had the pleasure of teaching 5 middle schoolers Computer Science concepts to help them build a mobile game of their own through the 
                    <a href="https://www.dreamsforschools.org/" target="blank">Dreams for Schools</a> organization.
                    Teaching has always been a passion of mine, so it was important to me to be able to share my knowledge of Computer Science concepts to cultivate young minds,
                    and get them involved and interested in STEM fields.
