                    <h1>The Most Iconic Album</h1>
                </header>
                <p> Each of the Beatles albums has left a lasting impact on the world. None have left an impact as great as
                    Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

        <h3>ICONOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>
            The Beatles have had many iconic covers, but none are more intriguing than Sgt. Pepper’s. 
            The cover’s riveting explosion of colors, objects, and face invites curiosity upon the beholder, leaving them 
            to wonder who the different faces are, and what significance the diverse assortment of objects play. 
        </p>

        <h3>TOUR DE FORCE</h3>
        <p>
            Sgt. Pepper is not simply an album, but an experience. The album was released after The Bealtes had decided to stop 
            performing live. To bring a more theatrical experience to thier audience's homes, Paul McCartney had the idea of 
            creating a fake band (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club) and The Beatles would perform with their alter egos. 
            From the beginning of side A, to the side of side B, the record follows the "live" concert of the band. Moreover, listerners
            can follow along with the lyrics written on the back of the album's gatfold cover, inviting them to pay attention to the message
            The Beatles are trying to deliver through the medium of music. 
        </p>

        <h3>SONGS</h3>
        <p>Although I enjoy all of the songs on this album, I dug a bit deeper into my favorites.</p>
        <p><b>"She's Leaving Home"</b></p>
        <p>
            “A-Level Girl Dumps Car and Vanishes” on London's Daily Mail. The doleful title inspired him to compose the beautifully crafted 
            narrative song She’s Leaving Home. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The song’s structure is cleverly framed as it provides the point of view of both the parents, and their daughter who is leaving home.
            On the one hand, the parents cannot comprehend why their daughter would be “thoughtless” enough to leave a home where they “gave her 
            everything money could buy.” However, a home without love is just a house, so she sought her own path. Naturally, there is some hesitance 
            in leaving the abode she lived in for so long as she “clutches her handkerchief”, but once she leaves, she is finally “free”. This 
            blatant juxtaposition between freedom and captivity adds an intriguing layer of complexity to the piece that leaves the listener sympathetic
            to both sides of the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            The song goes beyond the narrative as it has multiple instances of witty word play. Lennon, a fan of puns, contributes a clever use 
            of homonyms in these lyrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            “we gave her everything money could <i>buy</i>”
            <br>
            “we struggled hard all our lives to get <i>by</i>”
            <br>
            “fun was the one thing money can't <i>buy</i>”
            <br>
            “she’s leaving home, <i>bye, bye</i>”
        </p>
        <p>
            The repeated use of the phoneme “by” adds a dark comedic effect as it skilfully weaves the dismal narrative with playful lyrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the harmonies in the chorus blend seamlessly with the sustained vocals, providing a mystic quality to the mournful song. 
            Additionally, the use of a string octet accompanied by a harp underscores this enchanting quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without a doubt, this is my favorite song on this album. From the moment I heard the capering harp trills melt with the vocals and 
            instruments, I was enamored by the tune. Although the story is melancholic, it leaves the listener with a sense of hope as the daughter 
            seeks a better life, a happier life.
