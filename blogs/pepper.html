                <p> Each of the Beatles albums has left a lasting impact on the world. None have left an impact as great as
                    <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

        <h3>TOUR DE FORCE</h3>
        <p>
            Sgt. Pepper is not simply an album. It is an experience. The album was released after The Bealtes decided to stop 
            performing live. To bring a more theatrical atmosphere to thier audience's homes, Paul McCartney had the idea of 
            creating a fake band (Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) where The Beatles would perform as their alter egos. 
            From the beginning of side A, to the end of side B, the record follows the "live" concert of the band. Moreover, listerners
            can follow along with the lyrics written on the back of the album's gatefold cover. This was the first time listeners were encouraged to 
            observe the lyrics, stressing the importance of the message to be delivered. They were no longer singing rosy love songs.
            Rather, they explored themes of hardships, loss, and ennuis in life, while maintaing a generally positive attitiude about all the 
            themes discussed in thier lyrics. The range of topics was not the only advancement The Beatles made through this album.
        </p>
        <p>
            The album cover is iconic. The riveting explosion of colors, objects, and faces invites curiosity upon the beholder. Who are the different faces?
            What do the different objects mean? Why are there random statues everywhere? 
        </p>
        <p>
            The album is not only iconic for its artwork, but also for the progressive steps it took in experimental music. Never before had a popular rock band
            taken influence from Classical Indian or Avant-Garde genres, or used eccentric instuments like a comb and paper. Moreover, the work introduced the idea
            of a "concept album" as the entire body of work follows the theme of a phony psychedelic concert performed by Sgt. Pepper's Lonley Hearts
            Club Band. Through these steps, The Beatles opened the gates to new frontiers for the rest of the world to explore through music.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, since The Beatles no longer performed live, they took liberties in the music they composed and included sounds
            that they could not incorporate in live performaces --especially because thier fans always
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DfG7sml-Q" target="blank">screamed through their performances</a>-- 
            such as the gentle harp instrumentation in "She's Leaving Home", and the orchestral "Section X" in "A Day In The Life".
        </p>

        <h3>SONGS</h3>
        <p>Although I enjoy all of the songs on this album, I dug a bit deeper into my favorites.</p>
        <!--SHE'S LEAVING HOME-->
        <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaBPY78D88g" target="blank">"She's Leaving Home"</a></b></p>
        <p>
            “A-Level Girl Dumps Car and Vanishes” filled the front page on London's <i>Daily Mail</i>. The doleful title inspired Paul McCartney to compose the beautifully crafted 
            narrative song "She’s Leaving Home". 
        </p>
        <p>
            The song’s structure is cleverly framed as it provides the point of view of both the parents, and their daughter who is leaving home.
            On the one hand, the parents cannot comprehend why their daughter would be “thoughtless” enough to leave a home where they “gave her 
            everything money could buy.” However, a home without love is just a house, so she sought her own path. Naturally, there is some hesitance 
            in leaving the home she lived in for so long as she “clutches her handkerchief”, but once she leaves, she is finally “free”. This 
            blatant juxtaposition between freedom and captivity adds an intriguing layer of complexity to the piece that leaves the listener sympathetic
            to both sides of the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            The song goes beyond the narrative as it has multiple instances of witty word play. Lennon, a fan of puns, contributes a clever use 
            of homonyms in these lyrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            “we gave her everything money could <i>buy</i>”
            <br>
            “we struggled hard all our lives to get <i>by</i>”
            <br>
            “fun was the one thing money can't <i>buy</i>”
            <br>
            “she’s leaving home, <i>bye, bye</i>”
        </p>
        <p>
            The repeated use of the phoneme “by” adds a dark comedic effect as it skilfully weaves the dismal narrative with playful lyrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the harmonies in the chorus blend seamlessly with the sustained vocals, providing a mystic quality to the mournful song. 
            Additionally, the use of a string octet accompanied by a harp underscores this enchanting quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without a doubt, this is my favorite song on this album. From the moment I heard the capering harp trills melt with the vocals and 
            instrumentation, I was enamored by the tune. Although the story is melancholic, it leaves the listener with a sense of hope as the daughter 
            seeks a better life, a happier life.
        </p>

        <!--LOVELY RITA-->
        <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysDwR5SIR1Q" target="blank">"Lovely Rita"</a></b></p>
        <p>
            When Paul McCartney was visiting America, he heard the term “meter maid” which inspired him to write the song “Lovely Rita”.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple components in this song that make it interesting. The song begins with a gentle, echoing acoustic guitar. The backing vocals 
            channel the same reverberating quality to produce a delicate sound. Furthermore, The Beatles continue with their experimentation with whimsical 
            tunes as they hum through a paper and comb to produce the kazoo-like sound heard after the line “nothing can come between us”. These layers offer 
            more texture and character to the piece of music, making it more intriguing to hear the flirtatious interaction between the protagonist and 
            “Lovely Rita” herself. During the transitions between the verses, the playful piano keeps the lively spirit beaming through the song. The twist 
            in transition at the end hints at nature of the relationship between the protagonist and “Lovely Rita”. 
        </p>


        <!--A DAY IN THE LIFE-->
        <p><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usNsCeOV4GM" target="blank">"A Day In The Life"</a></b></p>
        <p>
            On December 18, 1966 the <i>London News</i> reported a fatal automobile accident. John Lennon was one of the readers of this tragic report. The 
            news, along with many of the other somber happenings in his life, inspired Lennon to write, “A Day In The Life”. This composition is one
            of The Beatles greatest works as it dives into realms of popular music that have never been ventured before this time.
            </p>
            <p>
            The first and second verses of the song discuss the accident detailed in the news article. The third verse references a war film, 
            most likely to be “How I Won the War” a film in which Lennon played a role. The fourth verse describes another news story which found that
            there were 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire. 
            </p>
            <p>
            These verses alone felt lacking to Lennon. They were poetic enough, but demanded a unifying element to weave the composition together. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Insert Paul McCartney. Lennon and McCartney have collaborated on numerous pieces of music, none of which have been as influential as
            “A Day In The Life.” 
            </p>
            <p>
            McCartney spent a significant amount of time in the London Underground scene where he was exposed to new forms and styles of music. He 
            had the idea of a “Section X” for quite sometime. He envisioned a mounting montage of sound inspired by Avant-Garde music such as Iannis 
            Xenakis’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZazYFchLRI" target="blank">“Metastasis”</a>. He requested the members of an orchestra 
            to start at the lowest note on their instrument and crechenso to the highest
            note over 24 bars of music. The classically trained musicians were appalled to receive such vague instructions. McCartney underscored 
            the importance of improvisation, and creating chaos with the sound, hence The Beatles’ producer, George Martin, wrote a rough musical 
            outline to guide the orchestra. "Section X" is interlaced between the third and fourth verse, and once again at the end of the song. 
            This section is unlike anything heard in popular music of the time. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The song also contains a nostalgic section written by McCartney looking back at his school boy days which acts as a transition between "Section 
            X" and Lennon’s final verse.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Beatles were pioneers of experimenting with a diverse set of new techniques and sounds. They weren’t making music for anyone, rather 
            producing art that pushed their imaginative and creative boundaries. 
            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of the song, is a hauntingly resonant E chord that sustains for 45 whole seconds. This chilling note will play on in history’s 
            ear as it ends the beautifully crafted piece.
            </p>
            <p>
            To keep the theme of a “never ending live concert” going, The Beatles inserted a dog whistle, and a loop of laughter at the end of the song. 
            The concert only ends when the listener chooses to lift the needle off the record. 
            This kind of innovation is what sets The Beatles apart from everybody else. Their music is not simply a tune, it is an experience.
